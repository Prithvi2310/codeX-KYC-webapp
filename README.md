An online video KYC solution

## About
Currently Know Your Customer (KYC) is largely an offline and manual process OR non-interactive online process. Create an online interactive process to do video KYC which is intuitive and self-sufficient. KYC should capture the userâ€™s live photograph and their basic details like name, DOB, address, pan card / Aadhaar, signature, income range, type of employment in a conversational manner. This tool should be highly inclusive and should have high reach across languages and generations irrespective of financial and education gap. 

## Purpose

 - We are team CodeX and we have developed a web application for Standard Chartered Hackathon.
 - We attempted making KYC an online process which makes it easy for everyone to use.
 - We have attempted to create a website that allows users to click pictures of their documents and we could then use AI to fill in their    information.
